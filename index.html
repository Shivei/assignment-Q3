	<p><b>1. Rolle’s Theorem</b></p>
<p>Let f : [a; b] ! R be continuous on [a,b] and
differentiable on (a,b), such that f(a)=f(b), where
a and b are some real numbers. Then there exists
some c in (a,b) such that f0(C)=0.</p>
<p>In other words, if a continuous curve passes
through the same y-value (such as the x􀀀axis)
twice and has a unique tangent line(derivative)
at every point of the interval, then somewhere
between the endpoints it has a tangent parallel
to the x 􀀀 axis. It has also used to prove the
Mean Value Theorem.</p>
<p><i>Applications:</i></p>
<p>1. Rolle’s theorem helps a lot in finding the
maximum height of the projectile trajectory.</p>
<p>2. It has played a vital role in bringing architectural
perfection in the construction of elliptical
domes that enhances the amplitude
of light (electromagnetic) and sound waves.
Rolle’s Theorem is a particular case of Mean
Value Theorem.</p>
<p><b>2. Mean Value Theorem</b></p>
<p>Let f : [a; b] ! R be a continuous function on
[a; b] and differentiable on (a; b). Then there
exists some c in (a; b) such that</p>
f<sup>`</sup>(c) = f(b) - f(a) &frasl; b-a
<p>In other words, there is a point c in (a; b) such
that the tangent at (c; f(c)) is parallel to the
secant between (a; f(a)) and (b; f(b)).</p>
<p><i>Applications:</i></p>
<p>1. MVT is used to study the properties of derivatives
and functions.</p>
<p>2. It is used to determine the existence and
uniqueness of the roots of the equation.</p>
<p>3. It is also used to prove equations and inequalities.</p>
